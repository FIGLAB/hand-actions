# Research Repository for Hand-Activities
This is the research repository for the CHI 2019 Paper: "Sensing Fine-Grained Hand Activity with Smartwatches." This repository contains links and instructions to a subset of our dataset.

# System Requirements
The system is written in `python3`, specifically `tensorflow` and `keras`.

To begin, we recommend using `virtualenv` to run a self-contained setup:
```bash
$ virtualenv ./hand-activities -p python3.6
$ source hand-activities/bin/activate
```

Once `virtualenv` is activated, install the following dependencies via `pip`:

```bash
(hand-activities)$ git clone https://github.com/FIGLAB/hand-activities.git
(hand-activities)$ pip install numpy
(hand-activities)$ pip install tensorflow
(hand-activities)$ pip install keras
(hand-activities)$ pip install wget
```

# Example Demos
Dataset will be available soon.
